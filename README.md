## Features  

- **Accurate Predictions**: Provides top predictions with probabilities for the next word based on user input.  
- **Real-Time Interaction**: User-friendly Streamlit interface for live predictions.  
- **Customizable Prediction Depth**: Returns the top `k` predictions, giving users flexibility.  
- **Seamless Tokenization**: Handles text preprocessing to ensure smooth prediction workflows.  
- **User-Centric Approach**: Designed to avoid displaying placeholder tokens like "unk" for a better user experience.
